The project began when Facebook Gaming - an upcoming livestreaming platform - and Streamlabs partnered to make it accessible to new and old streamers alike. With integration from SLOBS, users can easily jump straight into streaming on Facebook Gaming, and with the theme packages our team created, everything was essentially start-up and go.

I was asked to join a project team to create several theme packages (live screens and alerts) for the upcoming release of this collaboration. The design direction was set for a more modern and minimal type style, with bits of nostalgic design choices sprinkled in. High contrasts colors mixed with clean and simple designs are what made up the bulk of the themes, with more adventurous ones made for verity.

All starting screens and webcam frames/headers were made in Adobe Photoshop. All alert animations were made in Adobe After Effects. Most of the designs here were done with simple shapes. We wanted to keep everything as simple as possible while keeping it visually pleasing, thus we played a lot of various colors and shape combinations. For the alert animations, I took assets from the original live screens and manipulated them inside of Adobe After Effects to get the Streamlabs alert box.

Wizards of the Coasts partnered with Streamlabs in order to create streaming assets to launch with their new game 'Magic: The Gathering Arena'. This project was first introduced to me through a colleague, whom later brought me onto the project team. The goal was to create live screen overlays that looked like they were a part of the characters they were based off. 

My initial motivation was to examine standout features of each character and incorporate them into the design of the overlays. Colors also took a large role in the designs, as each was meant to represent a certain element. Each character's personality, powers, and overall aura found their way into the end project, resulting in overlays that feel like they were pulled right off an armor piece, or fabric design.

These themes are seen and downloaded by thousands of SLOBS users, you can view and use them yourself down below!

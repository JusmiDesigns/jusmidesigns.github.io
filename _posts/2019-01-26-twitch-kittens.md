I was brought on the Streamlabs creative team to design custom stream assets for TwitchKittens, a Twitch stream team consisting of over 20,000 members. These assets are integrated into the Streamlabs Library so TwitchKittens team members can install them in one click. I designed and animated custom alerts and overlays totaling over 72,000 downloads.

These stream assets are designed to compliment TwitchKittens existing art style, which was more of a 'modern' gaming style, geared towards that sort of esport aesthetic that a lot of streamers use. I also incorporated  some 3D renders I made myself into some of the designs, giving them more of a lively and unique look rather than just flat graphics.

All starting screens were made in Adobe Photoshop. All alerts were made in Adobe After Effects. I was asked to take inspiration from not only their existing overlays, but to focus on the 'esport' aesthetic, which is usually very clean and 'striking'. I had lots of fun coming up with various ideas, experiencing with textures and rendering my own custom 3D renders, as can be seen in some of the starting screens. Blender was used for the 3D objects.

For the alerts, I wanted them to be very eyecatching as soon as they popped up, thus most of the attention to detail is on the reveal, while the remainder of the alert is subtle to hold the viewers attention.
